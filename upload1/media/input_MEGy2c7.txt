[14/08/18, 7:50:51 PM] Aashish: Good intentions without actions, is like 

Soul without body, However pure it is, it can not bring any difference
[15/08/18, 6:45:36 AM] Aashish: We are like Sandalwood, containing essence of knowledge inside 

However the aroma of knowledge spreads, when we rub it through conversations, in presence of water 💦 of openness

Can we really expect FRESH thinking to flourish??

What if solving problems is left to youngsters, and older people play the coach
[18/08/18, 6:47:33 AM] Aashish: Ignorance is bliss 😇

Its so painful to be aware of negative effects of my own actions

Still falling victim of this uncontrolled mind 😂
