[15/08/18, 6:45:36 AM] Aashish: Good intentions without actions, is like 

Soul without body, However pure it is, it can not bring any difference
[15/08/18, 6:45:36 AM] Aashish: We are like Sandalwood, containing essence of knowledge inside 

However the aroma of knowledge spreads, when we rub it through conversations, in presence of water 💦 of openness

Can we really expect FRESH thinking to flourish??

What if solving problems is left to youngsters, and older people play the coach

Its so painful to be aware of negative effects of my own actions

Still falling victim of this uncontrolled mind 😂
